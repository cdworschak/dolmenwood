# Dolmenwood campaign details and overview

## lankshorn rumours
* King’s Mounds: The burial mounds in the woods to the south-east (0810) were originally built by the folk of the ancient King Hoarth, who would inter honoured warriors in woodland graves
* Nightworms: If you travel east along the Ditchway, make sure to stay off the road at night. The woods are teeming with giant red worms that crave human flesh (0809)
* The grimalkin’s revenge: The grimalkin proprietor of Bogway’s, Whimsly Bobblefrock, was bested in a game of cards by the illustrious Madame Shantywood. The vengeful fairy now hates Shantywood and is plotting a grisly doom for her.

## general rumours
* Rise of the talking beasts: The population of sapient beasts in Dolmenwood is growing, especially in the northern valley now known as the “Valley of Wise Beasts.” It is feared that some unknown force is rallying the talking beasts, preparing to overrun the forest and wrest town and bower from their rightful owners.
* Spies of the Cold Prince: There are reports of frost-clad fairies upon the roads of Dolmenwood—undoubtedly servants of the Cold Prince. It is claimed that these frigid elves will trade icy jewels and fairy silver in exchange for information about what goes on in the deep woods
* The dead in Dolmenwood: A curious property of Dolmenwood is that the souls of those who die there retain their connection to the corpse indefinitely. This is known, in scriptural terms, as “mortalism” and is a phenomenon of some dispute within the Pluritine Church. It is only through the careful ministrations of the order of Saint Signis the Silent (also known as the order of Lichwards) that the dead are put to rest.
* The Drunes’ vengeance: Red-eyed ravens and ghostly owls have been spied congregating around graveyards. This is an omen that the wrath of the Drune is turning toward the Pluritine Church, in reprisal for the recent attacks on the brotherhood by the witch-hunters of the order of St Faxis.
* The Nag-Lord moves south: Crookhorns have been sighted in the vicinity of the ruined abbey of St Clewyd of late, far to the south of their master’s dominion. The folk of Prigwort mutter fearfully of war. Word has it that the duke’s forces are massing in the town in anticipation of an attack.
* The wizard of Prigwort: A magician by the name of Droobe makes his home within the town of Prigwort. It is said that he is amenable to visitors seeking his arcane knowledge and is willing to place or lift curses for a fee. It is believed that his magic is responsible for the otherworldly quality of the spirits brewed in Prigwort.

## responses
* Sarah/Gabe
	* native exploreres and fortune seekers, focus on sandbox play
* Will
	* osr sandbox treasure hunt, gold-for-xp, emergent plot if any
* Cyrill
	* Campaign Style: I've always preferred sandboxes with a bit of player agency. Meta Quests are my favourites to both play and run.
	* Time Limit: I am more an event style when player action can actively change the course or speed of an overarching meta-event.
	* Campaign focus: Fighting against an ancient evil that has us exploring the world collecting, activating or even Destroying collectables as part of a meta quest to delay this force.
	* Cohesive group concept: Explorers chimes with me. but now with the whole not start knowing each other makes me think we might have our home town/village/settlement attacked and we are given the same objective that leads us to the same place at the same time with the same goal.

	* Sandbox with Background Plots (the world will move on if not interacted with, might not affect the players directly)
	* or: Plot-driven (like modern DnD, you are the main characters)
	* or: fully Player-Driven (no background plots, just player action and agency)
* Time limit: when to end the game
	* I would like to avoid an endless campaign that just peters out.
 	* During game play you will get a feel for the world and create a long-term goal for them to achieve

## general information
* Open table, one character at a time, feel free to make backup characters
* Missing characters and players will be present but can't interact, no need to return to safe haven every session
* Strict time keeping, seasons, weather inside and out of dungeons
* Fishing, Foraging, Hunting are all worthwhile pursuits: found herbs/mushrooms, animals etc have more than just generic value as rations
* Roughly late medieval period, no fire-arms
* Fairy / Elves (NPCs) are whimsical and alien, amoral and cruel, fanciful and capricious
* Church is strict monotheism
* The world outside the woods exists but should be irrelevant to the game besides fluff and context

## house rules
* Max HP on start, all dice re-rolled after that for each level; if new result is less than old only add one HP to old results, apply con bonus as usual after the fact
	* e.g. old HP at level 1, d6 HD, HP => 7 (6 + 1 con); re rolled 2d6 at level 2 (result is 5, of 3+2); add 1 to the 6 at level 1 and add con mod for each level for new HP => 9 (6 + 1 + 2 con)
* Shields and Helmets may shatter -> destroy equipment to negate deadly blow
* XP sources
	* XP for gold, loot the place bring it back to a safe place to get XP
	* Carousing and charity may increase the XP value
		* Magic items do not grant XP but are worth money if sold 
	* XP for "great deeds" at my discretion
	* XP for enemies as listed
	* "Feats of exploration"-style XP sources to incentivise exploration
		* Exploring new locations, entering new settlements for the first time, finding secrets, following rumours, meeting factions etc.

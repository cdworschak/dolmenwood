# Dolmenwood campaign details and overview

## responses
* Sarah/Gabe
	* native exploreres and fortune seekers, focus on sandbox play
* Will
	* osr sandbox treasure hunt, gold-for-xp, emergent plot if any
* Cyrill
	* Campaign Style: I've always preferred sandboxes with a bit of player agency. Meta Quests are my favourites to both play and run.
	* Time Limit: I am more an event style when player action can actively change the course or speed of an overarching meta-event.
	* Campaign focus: Fighting against an ancient evil that has us exploring the world collecting, activating or even Destroying collectables as part of a meta quest to delay this force.
	* Cohesive group concept: Explorers chimes with me. but now with the whole not start knowing each other makes me think we might have our home town/village/settlement attacked and we are given the same objective that leads us to the same place at the same time with the same goal.

## questions and guardrails
* Please read the Welcome to Dolmenwood PDF first to give you context
	* Check out the media touchstones, which most resonate with you?
* Campaign Type: what is your preference
	* Sandbox with Background Plots (the world will move on if not interacted with, might not affect the players directly)
	* or: Plot-driven (like modern DnD, you are the main characters)
	* or: fully Player-Driven (no background plots, just player action and agency)
* Time limit: when to end the game
	* I would like to avoid an endless campaign that just peters out.
 	* During game play you will get a feel for the world and create a long-term goal for them to achieve		
* Content warning: whimsy and horror, please tell me of any additions or exclusions
	* Whimsy and Horror in equal measure, German Fairy tales
	* Fantasy Violence
	* Cannibalism
	* Body-horror
* Campaign focus, all the below exists, but what do we care about
	* Nobility, Intrigue and Politics
	* Fight against the ancient evil
	* Return of the old enemy (open war)
	* Restoring the church
	* Destroy the Drune and/or Witches
	* Anything opposing the above (e.g. work with the Drune and/or Witches, bring down the Church etc)
	* A combination of the above
	* Dungeoneers and fortune seekers
	* Exploration
* Creating characters and the group
	* I don’t like to limit any choices but the character need to fit into the setting and the group
		* No OSE classes/races for the first character
	* possible group concepts and archetypes
		* Mercenaries or Heroes
		* Explorers or Colonisers
		* Agents of a power or Free agents
		* Outsiders or Natives  		
	* Honour restrictions on classes, be mindful that fey and demi-fey have mechanical effects against them in certain regions of the map
	* Standard creation rules apply
    * Slot based encumbrance
	* In some places being any of the kins might give you a social disadvantage but being found out to be fey can be dangerous around zealous folk anywhere

## general information
* Open table, one character at a time, feel free to make backup characters
* Missing characters and players will be present but can't interact, no need to return to safe haven every session
* Strict time keeping, seasons, weather inside and out of dungeons
* Fishing, Foraging, Hunting are all worthwhile pursuits: found herbs/mushrooms, animals etc have more than just generic value as rations
* Roughly late medieval period, no fire-arms
* Fairy / Elves (NPCs) are whimsical and alien, amoral and cruel, fanciful and capricious
* Church is strict monotheism
* The world outside the woods exists but should be irrelevant to the game besides fluff and context

## house rules
* Max HP on start, all dice re-rolled after that for each level; if new result is less than old only add one HP to old results, apply con bonus as usual after the fact
	* e.g. old HP at level 1, d6 HD, HP => 7 (6 + 1 con); re rolled 2d6 at level 2 (result is 5, of 3+2); add 1 to the 6 at level 1 and add con mod for each level for new HP => 9 (6 + 1 + 2 con)
* Shields and Helmets may shatter -> destroy equipment to negate deadly blow
* XP sources
	* XP for gold, loot the place bring it back to a safe place to get XP
	* Carousing and charity may increase the XP value
		* Magic items do not grant XP but are worth money if sold 
	* XP for "great deeds" at my discretion
	* XP for enemies as listed
	* "Feats of exploration"-style XP sources to incentivise exploration
		* Exploring new locations, entering new settlements for the first time, finding secrets, following rumours, meeting factions etc.
* Death's Door optional rule, DPG p.168 (2-6 chance to die every round until dead or healed; permanent loss of attribute after)

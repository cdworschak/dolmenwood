	* Sticky Gilly (4)
* XP from deeds / player: 125
	* find out about Lankston and St Howaerth's Hand via Elisa's ghost; find Rodger's body; follow up on Farnham's disappearance; find the passage in the Church; pray at the Altar of St Pastery; learn about Sticky Gilly and where to buy it
* XP from enemies / player: 82
	* bog corpses
* total XP / player: 407

The group moves away from the bog corpses until they reach a copse of elm trees. The undead stop and they take a few pot shots. They meet the ghost of Elisa, a girl from Lankston who tells them about the reliquiary of St Howaerth in the church.
They assume that the hand the crookhorns and Rodger are looking for and the holy reliquiary are one and the same. They cannot see a way forward withthe undead as there might just be more and more and they will run out of arrows soon.
They use string alcohol from Rodger's backpack to ignite one of the undead who runs towards the water and explodes upon destruction.

They choose to walk around the pool near the tree line to investigate the area and find Rodgers body on the other side of the pool, strangled to death. They find this out by distracting the undead which are still following them.
They do not have enough time to properly search Rodger and leave his corpse to be destroyed by the undead which retreat after being satisfied with his flesh. Rodger gets a quick, ad-hoc burial, just in case.

Upon return to town at night they get a bath and Gwynn goes to exchange some hares and mushrooms for a bottle of Nipper to mess with Newton.

The rest of the group tries to investigate the Sticky Gilly, ask about Farnham and Emelda, and just have a quiet night.

The next day they go to the apothecary to identify the Sticky Gilly and find out it gets sold in the Woodcutters encampment north of Dreg (to the east).
Joremy prays for the blessing of St Pastery and heals his eye.
Tristan takes a look at Farnham's room/study and finds correspondence with a Mr. Gryphius who wants him to translate a tome written in Oggam, and ancient Breggle dialect - mostly still present in arcane and occult tomes.
Joremy searches the church and find a font is moveable and underneath spots a hole, as well as an auburn lock of hair, which fits the description of Emelda Wishorn, the girl with th beatiful voice.

## session 2

* present: all
* XP from treasure / player: 3
	* Silver holy symbol (15gp)
* XP from rumours / player: 33.3 (Mind-addling substances, true)
* XP from deeds / player 66.6 (follow leads to Lankston and enter new hex, gather clues, find out about Bog Corpses etc.)
* total XP / player: 103
* new rumours encountered:
	* The dukes’ sinister pact: In ancient times, the Dukes of Brackenwold made pact with the secret gods of the Wood, being granted rulership over all of Dolmenwood for forty-four generations, in exchange for their souls after death. This time span has almost expired and it is surmised that ruin will soon befall the duke and his family.
	* Mind-addling substances: The local apothecary has begun stocking a range of weird substances. The proprietor, Sydewich Maldwort, makes regular trips to Dreg to acquire these compounds (and doubtless to also indulge in the pleasures the port-town has to offer).

The group returned to Lankshorn in time before sun-down with Maddie who they take back straight to the vicarage. They wait for Seargent Marge to leave the guard station to avoid Rodger Burl.

Maddie brings to their attention that the Vicar is gone and has either left and taken all his things or they were robbed and he was kidnapped. 
With everyone's help they find that the Vicar must have left on his own; leaving behind his holy symbol.

The group meet fully for the first time and investigate the Vicar's disappearance as well as waiting for the Sgt. To leave her station. They find her alone after her shift ends and tell her about the findings at the knoll. She pays out the reward as agreed and tells them of more disappearances:
Farnham Ribblemead the Sage, and Emelda, a local girl that sometimes sings at the inn.

The check Rodgers room and find the same human tallow candles hidden away as they had seen on the Knoll. A note written in crude Gaffe leads them to Lankston: "We meet at Lankston on Frisk in the evening to retrieve the hand."

They go to the local inn and hear from the landlady about the disappearances and her missing tenant Farnham. She confirms he did not leave by his own will because he'd rather die than leave his books behind.

After a night of drink, music, and rumours they sleep at the inn and make their way to Lankston the next  day.

Near Lankston Pool they see a camp for one person with no one present. Many footprints leading to and from the water. As they approach the water 5 bog corpses leave the water and get closer, the Bard warns of the stories told about these Undead.

**Pipes on Droomen Knoll**
The group approached the Fairy ruin on Droomen Knoll on the side of the Ditchway east of Lankshorn looking to verify rumours of Crookhorns and to find the missing Vicar Dobbey's maidservant Maddie.

They find and kill the Crookhorns with a lot of luck and help from the Thief's flute. 

The rescue Maddie from the lair and manage to solve the puzzle left behind by Lord Mallowheart and willingly free an Elf that is most thankful, yet disturbing.

The cleric Joremy contracts some kind of disease from the Crookhorns and now has an itchy eye.

They find a dead Drune, killed by a fall and/or Stirges on whom they find an orange crystal, which gives them an ominous vision: "Doom over the Hleribuck - The dead Soreror will rise again!"

On the Crookhorn leader they find a note mentioning a local contact to be met in two days time at night in Lankshorn - Rodger Burl

They are on their way back to Lankhorn at this moment with Maddie.

# Dolmenwood campaign details and overview

## lankshorn rumours
* King’s Mounds: The burial mounds in the woods to the south-east (0810) were originally built by the folk of the ancient King Hoarth, who would inter honoured warriors in woodland graves
* Nightworms: If you travel east along the Ditchway, make sure to stay off the road at night. The woods are teeming with giant red worms that crave human flesh (0809)
* The grimalkin’s revenge: The grimalkin proprietor of Bogway’s, Whimsly Bobblefrock, was bested in a game of cards by the illustrious Madame Shantywood. The vengeful fairy now hates Shantywood and is plotting a grisly doom for her.

## general rumours
* Rise of the talking beasts: The population of sapient beasts in Dolmenwood is growing, especially in the northern valley now known as the “Valley of Wise Beasts.” It is feared that some unknown force is rallying the talking beasts, preparing to overrun the forest and wrest town and bower from their rightful owners.
* Spies of the Cold Prince: There are reports of frost-clad fairies upon the roads of Dolmenwood—undoubtedly servants of the Cold Prince. It is claimed that these frigid elves will trade icy jewels and fairy silver in exchange for information about what goes on in the deep woods
* The dead in Dolmenwood: A curious property of Dolmenwood is that the souls of those who die there retain their connection to the corpse indefinitely. This is known, in scriptural terms, as “mortalism” and is a phenomenon of some dispute within the Pluritine Church. It is only through the careful ministrations of the order of Saint Signis the Silent (also known as the order of Lichwards) that the dead are put to rest.
* The Drunes’ vengeance: Red-eyed ravens and ghostly owls have been spied congregating around graveyards. This is an omen that the wrath of the Drune is turning toward the Pluritine Church, in reprisal for the recent attacks on the brotherhood by the witch-hunters of the order of St Faxis.
* The Nag-Lord moves south: Crookhorns have been sighted in the vicinity of the ruined abbey of St Clewyd of late, far to the south of their master’s dominion. The folk of Prigwort mutter fearfully of war. Word has it that the duke’s forces are massing in the town in anticipation of an attack.
* The wizard of Prigwort: A magician by the name of Droobe makes his home within the town of Prigwort. It is said that he is amenable to visitors seeking his arcane knowledge and is willing to place or lift curses for a fee. It is believed that his magic is responsible for the otherworldly quality of the spirits brewed in Prigwort.

## responses
* Sarah/Gabe
	* native exploreres and fortune seekers, focus on sandbox play
* Will
	* osr sandbox treasure hunt, gold-for-xp, emergent plot if any
* Cyrill
	* Campaign Style: I've always preferred sandboxes with a bit of player agency. Meta Quests are my favourites to both play and run.
	* Time Limit: I am more an event style when player action can actively change the course or speed of an overarching meta-event.
	* Campaign focus: Fighting against an ancient evil that has us exploring the world collecting, activating or even Destroying collectables as part of a meta quest to delay this force.
	* Cohesive group concept: Explorers chimes with me. but now with the whole not start knowing each other makes me think we might have our home town/village/settlement attacked and we are given the same objective that leads us to the same place at the same time with the same goal.
